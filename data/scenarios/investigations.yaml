# This is a config file to define questions that can be asked
# in Timesketch. A single question is by nature small in scope and tactical,
# something that can be answered by analysis, either automatically or by
# providing enough context so that an analyst can determine the answer.
#
# Each investigation consists of the following fields:
#
#                       -- metadata --
#       display_name        Simple string that contains the display name that
#                           be used in an UI to describe the question.
#
#       description         Further description of the question, what the
#                           question attempts to answer, whether it will
#                           require further manual analysis, etc.
